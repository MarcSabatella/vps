Visual Piano Studio

Visual Piano Studio allows you to easily create a screen layout
that shows your computer screen (to display sheet music)
and a camera focused on the piano keys.
Rather than provide an overwhelming variety of options
to create unlimited different layouts,
it just makes it simple to create one that works well.

To use this app, just point your browser at
https://marcsabatella.github.io/vps

You'll see a mostly empty window with a suggestion to scroll down for the controls.
Those controls allows you to start and stop the screen capture and to select, start, and stop the camera.
You can also adjust the size and position of the screen capture relative to the camera
and the cropping of the camera view.
After setting up your layout, scroll back up.
Your settings are remembered the next time you run the app.

You can then screen share this browser tab in your favorite video tool,
such as Screencastify or Zoom,
too create videos or live streams that show your screen and camera layout.
By sharing just the browser tab,
you can then switch to the whatever other app you wish to actually display as the screen capture.
Your viewers will see the full Visual Piano Studio layout, including the screen capture and the camera view,
while you work in the other app.

I recommend running the app without selecting any audio options,
unless you are comfortable working through the details of how to avoid feedback.
I normally just let sound play through a speaker and use a microphone to pick it up.
But, options are provide to share sound from the screen capture and to use a microphone,
with additional options to enable echo cancellation and other audio processing
to optimize the microphone for voice as opposed to music.
